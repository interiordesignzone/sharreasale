How can I start affiliate marketing with no money?

Affiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing. Publishers, also known as affiliates, promote products and brands for an advertiser, also known as a merchant or a brand. For each sale that they generate they are awarded a commission.
The system works via trackable links and data. Each publisher is given a unique link or code that identifies the customers that they have pointed toward an advertiserâ€™s brand. By keeping track of these customers, an advertiser can tell who has assisted them in making final sales and can award their affiliates with commissions for their efforts.
It is much easier to do all of this by joining an affiliate network, such as ShareASale. We simplify the entire process by creating unique affiliate links, keeping track of all the data associated with affiliate marketing for both publishers and advertisers, and even more importantly, we provide a platform where the two can meet and form great partnerships.
The goal for publishers is to get their audience to click on their affiliate link and make a purchase. Want to know more? Explore what affiliate marketing is further.
